I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology at the Department of Statistics and Data Science, Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/)). My current cumulative GPA ranks first in my major (1/53). My current research interest includes **Trustworthy AI**(MIA) and **LLMs**([\[research statements\]](https://fujump.github.io/assets/pdf/Research_Statement.pdf)). If given the opportunity, I would also be happy to try other interesting directions.

My advisor is [Bingyi Jing](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/jingbing-yi.html), and presently I am an intern in Professor [Hongxin Wei](https://hongxin001.github.io/)'s research group, where I conducted an independent study on MIA and participated in a corporate collaboration project on ICL. Additionally, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position starting in the fall of 2025 (with the possibility of starting earlier, as my senior year coursework is minimal).

I have always maintained an open attitude and a wide range of interests. In high school, I participated in the Chinese Physics Olympiad(CPhO) and won the first prize in Hunan Province. During my freshman year, I was selected into the Mathematics Elite Class (approximately 30 students from the entire university), demonstrating a strong foundation in mathematics. In my sophomore year, I developed an interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, took several relevant courses, and joined Professor Wei's research group in my junior year to engage in related research.
